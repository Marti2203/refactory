# Refactory: Re-factoring based Program Repair applied to Programming Assignments
## What is Refactory
Refactory is a fully automated approach for generating student program repairs in real-time. It refactors all available correct solutions to semantically equivalent solutions in an online/offline phase. Those solutions are then used to repair the incorrect solutions via search-based program synthesis.
